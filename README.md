# LCH Color Picker

## What is this project?

The **LCH Color Picker** is a minimalist utility designed to generate, preview, and validate colors based on the **Lightness, Chroma, and Hue (LCH)** model. This model offers perceptually uniform color manipulation and access to a wider color gamut compared to traditional HSL. It ensures user input adheres strictly to integer values between 0 and 100.

## How It Works

The application operates on three primary input values, translating the simplified 0-100 interface values into the full range required by the CSS `lch()` function.

### Input Fields

| Field | Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lightness** | 0-100 | Controls the brightness of the color (0 = black, 100 = white). |
| **Chroma** | 0-100 | Controls the intensity or saturation (multiplied by 1.5 for wider range). |
| **Hue** | 0-100 | Controls the matiz/angle (multiplied by 3.6 for 0 to 360 degrees). |

### Calculation Logic

The color value is generated by scaling the user's simplified 0-100 input into the full ranges required by the LCH model (L: 0-100, C: ~0-150, H: 0-360).

1.  **Lightness (L):** `L (0-100)` -> `L (CSS Value)`
2.  **Chroma (C) Scaling:** `Chroma (0-100)` x `1.5` -> `Chroma (CSS Value, 0-150)`
3.  **Hue (H) Scaling:** `Hue (0-100)` x `3.6` -> `Hue (CSS Value, 0-360)`
4.  **Color Output:** `lch(Lightness Chroma Hue)`

### Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input Validation** | Restricts all input fields to **integers** between 0 and 100. |
| **Random Color** | Generates a new, valid random color on click, updating all fields. |
| **Clear All** | Resets all input fields to empty, defaulting the color preview to `lch(0 0 0)`. |

### Output Display

| Element | Format | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Preview** | Live CSS Color | Displays the computed color as the background of a block element. |
| **Value** | `lch(L C H)` | Shows the final CSS-compatible LCH string (e.g., `lch(50 75 180)`).
